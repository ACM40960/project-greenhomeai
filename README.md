# GreenHome AI 🏡💡  
*Predicting CO₂ emissions & suggesting energy-efficient upgrades for Irish homes*

---

## 📌 Overview  
GreenHome AI is a machine learning–powered tool that estimates CO₂ emissions for residential properties based on building characteristics and suggests upgrade-friendly improvements.  

The project addresses the urgent need to reduce household emissions in Ireland by helping homeowners, policymakers, and energy consultants make data-driven retrofit decisions.

**Key Features**  
- Predict CO₂ emissions with high accuracy (LightGBM model with early stopping).  
- Identify upgrade-friendly features without data leakage.  
- Perform *what-if* analysis to simulate the impact of upgrades (walls, roofs, windows, heating).  
- Simple, reproducible workflow using R.
